# Computer_Graphics_Final_Project

The idea of the project is based on the common game “BattleShip”. 
We will have a battle grid field where the ships will be placed, one for each of the 2 players; the user will be able to place the ships where he/she likes. 
Once placed the ships the game will start giving to player 1 the possibility to choose which point of the adversary’s grid to attack, if a enemy’s boat is in that position a rocket starting from one of player 1 ship will go to that position causing the damage to that ship, otherwise the turn of player 1 will just end. At this point player 2 will do the same and so on. 

That’s the key idea of the game! 
For everything said, we will not focus on the game mechanics or the game performance, but on the game graphics using the various knowledge learned in the course, respecting the guide lines of the project.
